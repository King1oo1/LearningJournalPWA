               <!-- Answer to first journal question -->
            <h3>Mobile-First Design Approach</h3>
            <p>I began by designing with mobile devices in mind, utilising a layout with one column that eventually expands on larger screens. This method ensured that the essential content and functionality worked flawlessly on reduced viewports.</p>
            <!-- Answer to second journal question -->
            <h3>Most Useful HTML/CSS Concept</h3>
            <p>The CSS Flexbox concept was the most helpful one I used to create responsive layout structures and navigation. With Flexbox, creating flexible components that adjust to various screen sizes without requiring intricate computations was simple.</p>
            <!-- Answer to third journal question -->
            <h3>Most Challenging Aspect</h3>
            <p>The hardest things for me were choosing a breakpoint and media queries. To enable smooth transitions between layouts, the ideal breakpoints for various devices needed to be tested and adjusted.</p>
